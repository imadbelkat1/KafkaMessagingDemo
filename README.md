Kafka Application

This project demonstrates a simple Kafka application with a producer and consumer interacting through a Kafka topic. The application includes a Student object model that is sent and received as serialized messages.

Features:

Producer: Publishes a Student object as a serialized string to a Kafka topic.
Consumer: Listens to the Kafka topic and processes received messages.
Model: A Student class representing the data structure.
Project Structure:

StudentProducer.java: Sends Student objects to the Kafka topic.
StudentConsumer.java: Receives and processes Student objects from the Kafka topic.
Student.java: Represents the Student object with an ID and name.
pom.xml: Maven configuration file for dependencies and build settings.
Prerequisites:

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

Java 8 or later
Apache Kafka (version 3.0.0 recommended)
Maven (for building the project)

Setup and Usage:

### 1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/imadbelkat1/KafkaMessagingDemo.git cd KafkaApp

### 2. Start Kafka
Ensure Kafka is running on `localhost:9092`. Follow [Kafka Quickstart Guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) if needed.

### 3. Build the Project
Build the project using Maven:
```bash

java -cp target/KafkaApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar StudentProducer
```

### 5. Run the Consumer
Consume messages from the Kafka topic:
```bash
java -cp target/KafkaApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar StudentConsumer
```

## Configuration

### Kafka Settings
Kafka properties are defined in the producer and consumer code:
- **Producer**: `bootstrap.servers`, `key.serializer`, `value.serializer`
- **Consumer**: `bootstrap.servers`, `group.id`, `key.deserializer`, `value.deserializer`

### Topic Name
The topic name is set to `student-topic` in the code. Update it as needed.
